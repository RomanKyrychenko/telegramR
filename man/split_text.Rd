\usage{
split_text(
  text,
  entities,
  limit = 4096L,
  max_entities = 100L,
  split_at = c("\\\\n", "\\\\s", ".")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A character string representing the message text.}

\item{entities}{A list of entity objects (e.g., lists with 'offset' and 'length' fields)
representing the formatting entities in the text.}

\item{limit}{An integer specifying the maximum length of each individual message.
Default is 4096.}

\item{max_entities}{An integer specifying the maximum number of entities allowed
in each individual message. Default is 100.}

\item{split_at}{A character vector of regular expressions that determine where to
split the text. By default, it splits at newlines, spaces, or any character.
The last expression should match a character to ensure splitting.}
}
\value{
A list of lists, where each sublist contains a pair of (split_text, split_entities).
  Each pair represents a portion of the original text and its corresponding entities.
}
\description{
This function splits a message text and its associated entities into multiple
messages, each respecting the specified length and entity limits while preserving
formatting. It is useful for sending large messages as multiple parts without
breaking entity formatting.
