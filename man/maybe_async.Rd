\title{Maybe Async Utility Function}
\usage{
maybe_async(coro)
}
\arguments{
\item{coro}{A value that may be a future (from the 'future' package).}
}
\value{
The resolved value if \code{coro} is a future, otherwise \code{coro} unchanged.
}
\description{
This function checks if the provided coroutine or future is asynchronous.
If it is a future, it warns about experimental async support and resolves it synchronously.
Otherwise, it returns the input as-is. This is useful in contexts where asynchronous
operations need to be handled in a synchronous manner.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'future' package is used for async operations
library(future)
f <- future({ Sys.sleep(1); 42 })
result <- maybe_async(f)  # Will warn and resolve to 42
}
}
